# PCR 300/500/800 Librarian

## Overview
The PCR series of MIDI keyboards is well over 10 years old. Roland dropped software
support for these MIDI keyboards sometime ago. Modern operating systems like
Windows 10 and macOS X 10.15 are no longer supported with drivers and the PCR Editor
app.

The PCR Librarian is intended to be a stop-gap or fall-back app to allow
control maps to be backed up to a computer or downloaded from a computer 
to the PCR. Using the PCR Librarian you can receive the current or all 15 control
maps from the PCR or send one or all control maps to the PCR.

The PCR Librarian app is written in Python 3 using the TKinter GUI library.

## Set Up
You need a Python 3 version with the TKinter library installed. Most 
Python 3 distributions for Windows meet that requirement. However, the
stock version of Python 3 that comes with macOS X does not contain
TKinter. Therefore, if you are on macOX X, use brew to install the
latest version of Python 3.
